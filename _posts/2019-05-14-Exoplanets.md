Using many libraries in machine learning, was revised much
articles about astronomy to calulate some possible parameters, which we don't have it
through conventional observational methods.
Well, to accomplish this achievement was used the library tensorflow and neural networks with manipulation on dataset using the tidy data concept, but whether you want to know more details please email me.
