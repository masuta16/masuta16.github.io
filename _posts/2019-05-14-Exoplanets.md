Using many libraries in machine learning was revised many articles about astronomy to calculate some possible parameters, which we donâ€™t have it through conventional observational methods. Well, to accomplish this achievement was used the library TensorFlow and neural networks with manipulation on a dataset using the tidy data concept, but whether you want to know more details please email me.
